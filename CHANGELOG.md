NOTES:

* This Go module has been updated to Go 1.19 per the [Go support policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#378](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/issues/378))

## 3.4.3 (September 08, 2022)

NOTES:

* resource/random_password: The values for `lower`, `number`, `special`, `upper`, `min_lower`, `min_numeric`, `min_special`, `min_upper` and `length` could be null if the resource was imported using version 3.3.1 or before. The value for `length` will be automatically calculated and assigned and default values will be assigned for the other attributes listed after this upgrade ([#313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/313))
* resource/random_string: The values for `lower`, `number`, `special`, `upper`, `min_lower`, `min_numeric`, `min_special`, `min_upper` and `length` could be null if the resource was imported using version 3.3.1 or before. The value for `length` will be automatically calculated and assigned and default values will be assigned for the other attributes listed after this upgrade ([#313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/313))
* resource/random_password: If the resource was created between versions 3.4.0 and 3.4.2, the `bcrypt_hash` value would not correctly verify against the `result` value. Affected resources will automatically regenerate a valid `bcrypt_hash` after this upgrade. ([#308](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/308))
* resource/random_password: The `override_special` attribute may show a plan difference from empty string (`""`) to `null` if previously applied with version 3.4.2. The plan should show this as an in-place update and it should occur only once after upgrading. ([#312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/312))
* resource/random_string: The `override_special` attribute may show a plan difference from empty string (`""`) to `null` if previously applied with version 3.4.2. The plan should show this as an in-place update and it should occur only once after upgrading. ([#312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/312))

BUG FIXES:

* resource/random_password: Assign default values to `lower`, `number`, `special`, `upper`, `min_lower`, `min_numeric`, `min_special` and `min_upper` if null. Assign length of `result` to `length` if null ([#313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/313))
* resource/random_string: Assign default values to `lower`, `number`, `special`, `upper`, `min_lower`, `min_numeric`, `min_special` and `min_upper` if null. Assign length of `result` to `length` if null ([#313](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/313))

* resource/random_password: Prevented difference with `override_special` when upgrading from version 3.3.2 and earlier ([#312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/312))
* resource/random_string: Prevented difference with `override_special` when upgrading from version 3.3.2 and earlier ([#312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/312))

## 3.4.2 (September 02, 2022)

BUG FIXES:

* all: Prevent `keeper` with `null` values from forcing replacement ([305](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/305)).
* resource/random_password: During upgrade state, ensure `min_upper` is populated ([304](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/304)).
* resource/random_string: During upgrade state, ensure `min_upper` is populated ([304](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-random/pull/304)).

## 3.3.0 (June 06, 2022)

ENHANCEMENTS:

NOTES:

* Updated [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs) to `v0.7.0`:
  this improves generated documentation, with attributes now correctly formatted as `code`
  and provided with anchors.
* Functionally identical to the previous 3.1.0 release.

## 3.1.0 (February 19, 2021)

Binary releases of this provider now include the darwin-arm64 platform. This version contains no further changes.

## 3.0.1 (January 12, 2021)

## 3.0.0 (October 09, 2020)

Binary releases of this provider will now include the linux-arm64 platform.

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Upgrade to version 2 of the Terraform Plugin SDK, which drops support for Terraform 0.11. This provider will continue to work as expected for users of Terraform 0.11, which will not download the new version. ([#118](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/118))
* Remove deprecated `b64` attribute ([#118](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/118))

## 2.2.1 (September 25, 2019)

NOTES:

* The provider has switched to the standalone TF SDK, there should be no noticeable impact on compatibility. ([#76](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/76))

## 2.2.0 (August 08, 2019)

NEW FEATURES:

* `random_password` is similar to `random_string` but is marked sensitive for logs and output [[#52](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/52)] 

## 2.1.2 (April 30, 2019)

* This release includes another Terraform SDK upgrade intended to align with that being used for other providers as we prepare for the Core v0.12.0 release. It should have no significant changes in behavior for this provider.

## 2.1.1 (April 12, 2019)

* This release includes only a Terraform SDK upgrade intended to align with that being used for other providers as we prepare for the Core v0.12.0 release. It should have no significant changes in behavior for this provider.

NEW FEATURES:

* `random_uuid` generates random uuid string that is intended to be used as unique identifiers for other resources ([#38](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/38))

BUG FIXES: 
* Use UnixNano() instead of Unix() for the current time seed in NewRand() ([#27](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/27))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Replace ReadPet function in `resource_pet` with schema.Noop ([#34](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-random/issues/34))

## 1.3.1 (May 22, 2018)
