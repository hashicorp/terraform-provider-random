# random_bytes (Ephemeral Resource)

-> If the managed resource doesn't have a write-only argument available for the secret (first introduced in Terraform 1.11), then the secret can only be created with the managed resource variant of [`random_bytes`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs/resources/bytes).

Generates ephemeral random bytes using a cryptographic random number generator.

The primary use-case for generating ephemeral random bytes is to be used in combination with a write-only argument in a managed resource, which will avoid Terraform storing the secret value in the plan or state file.

## Example Usage

```terraform
ephemeral "random_bytes" "secret" {
  length = 64
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The number of bytes requested. The minimum value for length is 1.

### Read-Only

- `base64` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in base64 string format.
- `hex` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in lowercase hexadecimal string format. The length of the encoded string is exactly twice the `length` parameter.
