# random_integer (Resource)

The resource `randomInteger` generates random values from a given range, described by the `min` and `max` attributes of a given resource.

This resource can be used in conjunction with resources that have the `createBeforeDestroy` lifecycle flag set, to avoid conflicts with unique names during the brief period where both the old and new resources exist concurrently.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AlbListenerRule } from "./.gen/providers/aws/alb-listener-rule";
import { Integer } from "./.gen/providers/random/integer";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: aws.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const priority = new Integer(this, "priority", {
      keepers: {
        listener_arn: listenerArn.stringValue,
      },
      max: 50000,
      min: 1,
    });
    new AlbListenerRule(this, "main", {
      action: [
        {
          target_group_arn: targetGroupArn.value,
          type: "forward",
        },
      ],
      listener_arn: Fn.lookupNested(priority, ["keepers", "listener_arn"]),
      priority: priority.result,
    });
  }
}

```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `max` (Number) The maximum inclusive value of the range.
- `min` (Number) The minimum inclusive value of the range.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- `seed` (String) A custom seed to always produce the same value.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The string representation of the integer result.
- `result` (Number) The random integer result.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random integers can be imported using the result, min, and max, with an
# optional seed. This can be used to replace a config value with a value
# interpolated from the random provider without experiencing diffs.

# Example (values are separated by a ,):
terraform import random_integer.priority 15390,1,50000
```
