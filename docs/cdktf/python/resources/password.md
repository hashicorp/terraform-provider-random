# random_password (Resource)

Identical to [random_string](string.html) with the exception that the result is treated as sensitive and, thus, _not_ displayed in console output. Read more about sensitive data handling in the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html).

This resource *does* use a cryptographic random number generator.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.db_instance import DbInstance
from imports.random.password import Password
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        password = Password(self, "password",
            length=16,
            override_special="!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?",
            special=True
        )
        DbInstance(self, "example",
            allocated_storage=64,
            engine="mysql",
            instance_class="db.t3.micro",
            password=password.result,
            username="someone"
        )
```

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The length of the string desired. The minimum value for length is 1 and, length must also be >= (`min_upper` + `min_lower` + `min_numeric` + `min_special`).

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- `lower` (Boolean) Include lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- `min_lower` (Number) Minimum number of lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_numeric` (Number) Minimum number of numeric characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_special` (Number) Minimum number of special characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_upper` (Number) Minimum number of uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `number` (Boolean, Deprecated) Include numeric characters in the result. Default value is `true`. **NOTE**: This is deprecated, use `numeric` instead.
- `numeric` (Boolean) Include numeric characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- `override_special` (String) Supply your own list of special characters to use for string generation.  This overrides the default character list in the special argument.  The `special` argument must still be set to true for any overwritten characters to be used in generation.
- `special` (Boolean) Include special characters in the result. These are `!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?`. Default value is `true`.
- `upper` (Boolean) Include uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.

### Read-Only

- `bcrypt_hash` (String, Sensitive) A bcrypt hash of the generated random string. **NOTE**: If the generated random string is greater than 72 bytes in length, `bcrypt_hash` will contain a hash of the first 72 bytes.
- `id` (String) A static value used internally by Terraform, this should not be referenced in configurations.
- `result` (String, Sensitive) The generated random string.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import random_password.password securepassword
```

### Limitations of Import

Any attribute values that are specified within Terraform config will be
ignored during import and all attributes that have defaults defined within
the schema will have the default assigned.

For instance, using the following config during import:
```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.random.password import Password
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Password(self, "password",
            length=16,
            lower=False
        )
```

Then importing the resource using `terraform import random_password.password securepassword`,
would result in the triggering of a replacement (i.e., destroy-create) during the next
`terraform apply`.

### Avoiding Replacement

If the resource were imported using `terraform import random_password.password securepassword`,
replacement could be avoided by using:

1. Attribute values that match the imported ID and defaults:

    ```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.random.password import Password
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Password(self, "password",
            length=14,
            lower=True
        )
```


2. Attribute values that match the imported ID and omit the attributes with defaults:

    ```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.random.password import Password
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Password(self, "password",
            length=14
        )
```


3. `ignore_changes` specifying the attributes to ignore:

    ```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from cdktf import TerraformResourceLifecycle
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.random.password import Password
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        Password(self, "password",
            length=16,
            lifecycle=TerraformResourceLifecycle(
                ignore_changes=[length, lower]
            ),
            lower=False
        )
```

    **NOTE** `ignore_changes` is only required until the resource is recreated after import,
    after which it will use the configuration values specified.
