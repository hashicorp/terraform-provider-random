# random_id (Resource)

The resource `random_id` generates random numbers that are intended to be
used as unique identifiers for other resources. If the output is considered 
sensitive, and should not be displayed in the CLI, use `random_bytes`
instead.

This resource *does* use a cryptographic random number generator in order
to minimize the chance of collisions, making the results of this resource
when a 16-byte identifier is requested of equivalent uniqueness to a
type-4 UUID.

This resource can be used in conjunction with resources that have
the `create_before_destroy` lifecycle flag set to avoid conflicts with
unique names during the brief period where both the old and new resources
exist concurrently.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.instance import Instance
from imports.random.id import Id
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        server = Id(self, "server",
            byte_length=8,
            keepers={
                "ami_id": ami_id.string_value
            }
        )
        aws_instance_server = Instance(self, "server_1",
            ami=Token.as_string(Fn.lookup_nested(server, ["keepers", "ami_id"])),
            tags={
                "Name": "web-server ${" + server.hex + "}"
            }
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        aws_instance_server.override_logical_id("server")
```

## Schema

### Required

- `byte_length` (Number) The number of random bytes to produce. The minimum value is 1, which produces eight bits of randomness.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- `prefix` (String) Arbitrary string to prefix the output value with. This string is supplied as-is, meaning it is not guaranteed to be URL-safe or base64 encoded.

### Read-Only

- `b64_std` (String) The generated id presented in base64 without additional transformations.
- `b64_url` (String) The generated id presented in base64, using the URL-friendly character set: case-sensitive letters, digits and the characters `_` and `-`.
- `dec` (String) The generated id presented in non-padded decimal digits.
- `hex` (String) The generated id presented in padded hexadecimal digits. This result will always be twice as long as the requested byte length.
- `id` (String) The generated id presented in base64 without additional transformations or prefix.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random IDs can be imported using the b64_url with an optional prefix. This
# can be used to replace a config value with a value interpolated from the
# random provider without experiencing diffs.

# Example with no prefix:
terraform import random_id.server p-9hUg

# Example with prefix (prefix is separated by a ,):
$ terraform import random_id.server my-prefix-,p-9hUg
```
