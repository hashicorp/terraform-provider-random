# random_bytes (Resource)

The resource `random_bytes` generates random bytes that are intended to be used as a secret, or key. Use this in preference to `random_id` when the output is considered sensitive, and should not be displayed in the CLI.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.azurerm.key_vault_secret import KeyVaultSecret
from imports.random. import Bytes
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: azurerm.
        #     For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.
        jwt_secret = Bytes(self, "jwt_secret",
            length=64
        )
        azurerm_key_vault_secret_jwt_secret = KeyVaultSecret(self, "jwt_secret_1",
            key_vault_id="some-azure-key-vault-id",
            name="JwtSecret",
            value=jwt_secret.base64
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        azurerm_key_vault_secret_jwt_secret.override_logical_id("jwt_secret")
```

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The number of bytes requested. The minimum value for length is 1.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `base64` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in base64 string format.
- `hex` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in hex string format.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random bytes can be imported by specifying the value as base64 string.
terraform import random_bytes.basic "8/fu3q+2DcgSJ19i0jZ5Cw=="
```
