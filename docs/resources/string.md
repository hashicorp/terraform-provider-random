# random_string (Resource)

The resource `random_string` generates a random permutation of alphanumeric characters and optionally special characters.

This resource *does* use a cryptographic random number generator.

Historically this resource's intended usage has been ambiguous as the original example used it in a password. For backwards compatibility it will continue to exist. For unique ids please use [random_id](id.html), for sensitive random values please use [random_password](password.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "random_string" "random" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "/@£$"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **length** (Number) The length of the string desired.

### Optional

- **keepers** (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- **lower** (Boolean) Include lowercase alphabet characters in the result.
- **min_lower** (Number) Minimum number of lowercase alphabet characters in the result.
- **min_numeric** (Number) Minimum number of numeric characters in the result.
- **min_special** (Number) Minimum number of special characters in the result.
- **min_upper** (Number) Minimum number of uppercase alphabet characters in the result.
- **number** (Boolean) Include numeric characters in the result.
- **override_special** (String) Supply your own list of special characters to use for string generation.  This overrides the default character list in the special argument.  The `special` argument must still be set to true for any overwritten characters to be used in generation.
- **special** (Boolean) Include special characters in the result. These are `!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?`
- **upper** (Boolean) Include uppercase alphabet characters in the result.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) The generated random string.
- **result** (String) The generated random string.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Strings can be imported by just specifying the value of the string:
terraform import random_string.test test
```
