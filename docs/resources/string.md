# random_string (Resource)

The resource `random_string` generates a random permutation of alphanumeric characters and optionally special characters.

This resource *does* use a cryptographic random number generator.

Historically this resource's intended usage has been ambiguous as the original example used it in a password. For backwards compatibility it will continue to exist. For unique ids please use [random_id](id.html), for sensitive random values please use [random_password](password.html).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "random_string" "random" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "/@Â£$"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The length of the string desired.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- `lower` (Boolean) Include lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- `min_lower` (Number) Minimum number of lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_numeric` (Number) Minimum number of numeric characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_special` (Number) Minimum number of special characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `min_upper` (Number) Minimum number of uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- `number` (Boolean) Include numeric characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- `override_special` (String) Supply your own list of special characters to use for string generation.  This overrides the default character list in the special argument.  The `special` argument must still be set to true for any overwritten characters to be used in generation.
- `special` (Boolean) Include special characters in the result. These are `!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?`. Default value is `true`.
- `upper` (Boolean) Include uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The generated random string.
- `result` (String) The generated random string.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Strings can be imported by just specifying the value of the string:
terraform import random_string.test test
```
