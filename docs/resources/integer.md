# random_integer (Resource)

The resource `random_integer` generates random values from a given range, described by the `min` and `max` attributes of a given resource.

This resource can be used in conjunction with resources that have the `create_before_destroy` lifecycle flag set, to avoid conflicts with unique names during the brief period where both the old and new resources exist concurrently.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example shows how to generate a random priority
# between 1 and 50000 for a aws_alb_listener_rule resource:

resource "random_integer" "priority" {
  min = 1
  max = 50000
  keepers = {
    # Generate a new integer each time we switch to a new listener ARN
    listener_arn = var.listener_arn
  }
}

resource "aws_alb_listener_rule" "main" {
  listener_arn = random_integer.priority.keepers.listener_arn
  priority     = random_integer.priority.result

  action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = var.target_group_arn
  }
  # ... (other aws_alb_listener_rule arguments) ...
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `max` (Number) The maximum inclusive value of the range.
- `min` (Number) The minimum inclusive value of the range.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- `seed` (String) A custom seed to always produce the same value.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The string representation of the integer result.
- `result` (Number) The random integer result.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random integers can be imported using the result, min, and max, with an
# optional seed. This can be used to replace a config value with a value
# interpolated from the random provider without experiencing diffs.

# Example (values are separated by a ,):
terraform import random_integer.priority 15390,1,50000
```
