# random_password (Resource)

Identical to [random_string](string.html) with the exception that the result is treated as sensitive and, thus, _not_ displayed in console output. Read more about sensitive data handling in the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html).

This resource *does* use a cryptographic random number generator.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "random_password" "password" {
  length           = 16
  special          = true
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  instance_class    = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage = 64
  engine            = "mysql"
  username          = "someone"
  password          = random_password.password.result
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **length** (Number) The length of the string desired.

### Optional

- **keepers** (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.
- **lower** (Boolean) Include lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- **min_lower** (Number) Minimum number of lowercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- **min_numeric** (Number) Minimum number of numeric characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- **min_special** (Number) Minimum number of special characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- **min_upper** (Number) Minimum number of uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `0`.
- **number** (Boolean) Include numeric characters in the result. Default value is `true`.
- **override_special** (String) Supply your own list of special characters to use for string generation.  This overrides the default character list in the special argument.  The `special` argument must still be set to true for any overwritten characters to be used in generation.
- **special** (Boolean) Include special characters in the result. These are `!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?`. Default value is `true`.
- **upper** (Boolean) Include uppercase alphabet characters in the result. Default value is `true`.

### Read-Only

- **id** (String) A static value used internally by Terraform, this should not be referenced in configurations.
- **result** (String, Sensitive) The generated random string.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random Password can be imported by specifying the value of the string:
terraform import random_password.password securepassword
```
