# random_bytes (Resource)

The resource `random_bytes` generates random bytes that are intended to be used as a secret, or key. Use this in preference to `random_id` when the output is considered sensitive, and should not be displayed in the CLI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "random_bytes" "jwt_secret" {
  length = 64
}

resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "jwt_secret" {
  key_vault_id = "some-azure-key-vault-id"
  name         = "JwtSecret"
  value        = random_bytes.jwt_secret.base64
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The number of bytes requested. The minimum value for length is 1.

### Optional

- `keepers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger recreation of resource. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `base64` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in base64 string format.
- `hex` (String, Sensitive) The generated bytes presented in hex string format.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Random bytes can be imported by specifying the value as base64 string.
terraform import random_bytes.basic "8/fu3q+2DcgSJ19i0jZ5Cw=="
```
