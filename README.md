# Terraform Provider: Random

The Random provider supports the use of randomness within Terraform configurations. The
provider resources can be used to generate a random [id](docs/resources/id.md),
[integer](docs/resources/integer.md), [password](docs/resources/password.md),
[pet](docs/resources/pet.md), [shuffle](docs/resources/shuffle.md) (random permutation
of a list of strings), [string](docs/resources/string.md) or 
[uuid](docs/resources/uuid.md).

## Documentation, questions and discussions

Official documentation on how to use this provider can be found on the
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest/docs).
In case of specific questions or discussions, please use the
HashiCorp [Terraform Providers Discuss forums](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers/31),
in accordance with HashiCorp [Community Guidelines](https://www.hashicorp.com/community-guidelines).

We also provide:

* [Support](.github/SUPPORT.md) page for help when using the provider
* [Contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines in case you want to help this project
* [Design](DESIGN.md) documentation to understand the scope and maintenance decisions

The remainder of this document will focus on the development aspects of the provider.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (>= 0.12)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.21)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) (optional)

## Development

### Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory
2. `make build` will trigger the Golang build

The provided `GNUmakefile` defines additional commands generally useful during development,
like for running tests, generating documentation, code formatting and linting.
Taking a look at it's content is recommended.

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can run

* `make test` to run provider tests
* `make testacc` to run provider acceptance tests

It's important to note that acceptance tests (`testacc`) will actually spawn
`terraform` and the provider. Read more about they work on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests).

### Generating documentation

This provider uses [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/)
to generate documentation and store it in the `docs/` directory.
Once a release is cut, the Terraform Registry will download the documentation from `docs/`
and associate it with the release version. Read more about how this works on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).

Use `make generate` to ensure the documentation is regenerated with any changes.

### Using a development build

If [running tests and acceptance tests](#testing) isn't enough, it's possible to set up a local terraform configuration
to use a development builds of the provider. This can be achieved by leveraging the Terraform CLI
[configuration file development overrides](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers).

First, use `make install` to place a fresh development build of the provider in your [`${GOBIN}`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) (defaults to `${GOPATH}/bin` or `${HOME}/go/bin` if `${GOPATH}` is not set). Repeat
this every time you make changes to the provider locally.

Then, in your `${HOME}/.terraformrc` (Unix) / `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` (Windows), a `provider_installation` that contains
the following `dev_overrides`:

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "hashicorp/random" = "${GOBIN}" //< replace `${GOBIN}` with the actual path on your system
  }

  direct {}
}
```

Note that it's also possible to use a dedicated Terraform configuration file and invoke `terraform` while setting
the environment variable `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE=my_terraform_config_file`.

Once the `dev_overrides` are in place, any local execution of `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` will
use the version of the provider found in the given `${GOBIN}` directory,
instead of the one indicated in your terraform configuration.

### Testing GitHub Actions

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests) to realize its CI.

Sometimes it might be helpful to locally reproduce the behaviour of those actions,
and for this we use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Once installed, you can _simulate_ the actions executed
when opening a PR with:

```shell
# List of workflows for the 'pull_request' action
$ act -l pull_request

# Execute the workflows associated with the `pull_request' action 
$ act pull_request
```

## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions, and it's defined in the Workflow
[release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

Each release is cut by pushing a [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/) tag to the default branch.
